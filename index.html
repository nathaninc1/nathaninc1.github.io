		<p class="About-us-para"> Toronto Senior Care was established in Toronto in 2006 and whose mission every day, 365 days a year, is to provide the best senior care through its wide range of well developed and proven senior care support services. These senior care support services have been able to provide hundreds and thousands of seniors in Toronto with virtually all the non-medical support they require to live safely and as independently as possible. We strongly believe that every senior should maximize every one of their days in terms of general wellbeing and enjoyment.

		We offer our senior care services throughout Toronto and the surrounding areas. All senior care is tailored to the needs of each senior using an effective assessment to ensure that the time we spend with them provides the senior with the greatest level of comfort, satisfaction and safety.  </p>
